#Conlissions

Two particles are generated. They start moving in a square box and bounce against the walls 

##Getting started
###Dependencies
*random

###Installing
Git clone repository

###Executing program

You need to execute the scripts in the next order:
1. main.py
2. make_gif.py
3. erase_jpg_files.py

The final product is a gif called my_awsome.gif

###Not solved, yet
*Particles dispappear for a moment and go out of the box. 
 This happens because bounce functions do not return 
 position on the wall, only velocity as particle bonce.
